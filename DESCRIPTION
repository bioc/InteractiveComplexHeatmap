Description: This package can easily make interactive heatmaps which are produced 
    by the ComplexHeatmap package. It provides two types of interactivities: 
    1. on the interactive graphics device, and 2. on a Shiny app. It also provides 
    functions for integrating the interactive heatmap widgets into other Shiny apps.
