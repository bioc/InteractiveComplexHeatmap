```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    error = FALSE,
    tidy  = FALSE,
    message = FALSE,
    warning = FALSE,
    fig.align = "center"
)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(InteractiveComplexHeatmap))
```

In **ComplexHeatmap**, functions `decorate_*()` are used to add graphics after
the heatmaps are drawn. To also put the decoration graphics in the heatmaps in
the Shiny app, user needs to wrap all the decoration code into a function and
send it to `post_fun` argument in `draw()` function. For example, the following
code to generate a decorated heatmap:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ComplexHeatmap)
m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10)
ht = Heatmap(m, name = "foo")
ht = draw(ht)
decorate_heatmap_body("foo", {
    grid.text("some text", gp = gpar(fontsize = 30))
})
```

To export it as a Shiny app also with decorations, the code needs to be slightly 
adjusted as:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InteractiveComplexHeatmap)
post_fun = function(ht_list) {
    decorate_heatmap_body("foo", {
        grid.text("some text", gp = gpar(fontsize = 30))
    })
}
ht = draw(ht, post_fun = post_fun)
htShiny(ht)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/decoration.png")
```


`post_fun` is a self-defined function and always needs one argument `ht_list`.

Note the decorations will not be applied on the sub-heatmap.
