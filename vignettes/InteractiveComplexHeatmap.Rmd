## Install

**InteractiveComplexHeatmap** is available on
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/InteractiveComplexHeatmap/),
you can install it by:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("InteractiveComplexHeatmap")
```

If you want the latest version, install it directly from GitHub:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("jokergoo/InteractiveComplexHeatmap")
```

## Usage

The **InteractiveComplexHeatmap** package is very straightforward to use. For
any heatmap (or list of heatmaps as a `Heatmap` or `HeatmapList` object)
produced from **ComplexHeatmap** package, you just use the function
`htShiny()` to export it as a Shiny app.

You can copy and paste the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ComplexHeatmap)
library(InteractiveComplexHeatmap)
m = matrix(rnorm(100*100), nrow = 100)
ht = Heatmap(m)
ht = draw(ht) # not necessary, but recommended

htShiny(ht)
```

A link will be opend in your web browser automatically (or a pop-up window in RStudio IDE).

To use `htShiny()`, the `Heatmap`/`HeatmapList` object is not necessary to be
updated with `draw()` and it will be applied inside `htShiny()`
automatically. However, updating by `draw()` will speed up the loading of the
Shiny app because `draw()` applies clustering (which is normally the most
time-consuming part) and the clustering results are saved the heatmap object.
If your heatmap includes randomness, such as k-means clustring by setting
`row_km` or `column_km` argument, then you must execute `draw()` before
sending to `htShiny()`.


Following screenshot demonstrates the Shiny app on rather complex heatmaps.
The data is from
[here](http://jokergoo.github.io/supplementary/ComplexHeatmap-supplementary1-4/supplS2_scRNASeq/supplS2_scRNAseq.html)
and the app can be generated by running `htShinyExample(4.2)`.

In this Shiny app, users can click on the orignal heatmap or select an area
from it. The information of the cell or the area selected by users can be
found in the text below the heatmaps. If an area is selected, a sub-heatmap is
drawn on the right side of the app. Both heatmaps can be resized by dragging
from the bottom right.

<p><img width='100%' style='border:1px solid grey;padding: 4px;' src='https://jokergoo.github.io/images/example3.gif' /></p>

There are several tools under both heatmaps. For the original heatmap, there are following tools:

1. *Search in heatmaps*

It allows to search the heatmap labels to obtain a subset of rows and columns. Once rows or columns are found
in the heatmaps, the sub-heatmaps will be drawn in the right panel.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/tool_search.png")
```

2. *Config brush*

Border and backgroud of the brush can be configured here:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/tool_brush.png")
```

3. *Save image*

The main heatmap can be saved into a file with one of the three formats (`png`, `pdf` and `svg`).

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/tool_save_image.png")
```

4. *Resize image*

The size of the original heatmap can be controlled by dragging the box,
however, it can be precisely controlled by entering the width and height, as
shown in the following figure:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/tool_resize.png")
```

For the sub-heatmap, there are following tools:

1. *Configure sub-heatmaps*

You can control whether to show row/column names in the sub-heatmaps, and whether
to show the annotations as well.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/tool_subheatmap.png")
```

2. *Export table*

The values in the sub-heatmaps can be viewed and exported as a text table:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/tool_table.png")
```

3. *Save sub-heatmap as an image*

Similar as in the main heatmap.

4. *Resize sub-heatmaps*

Similar as in the main heatmap.

## Use last generated heatmaps

**ComplexHeatmap** is broadly used in many other scripts and packages where
they do not directly return the `Heatmap`/`HeatmapList` object. This is of no
problem to make these heatmaps interactive because the last generated heatmap
object is automatically saved and calling `htShiny()` without the heatmap
object will automatically use the last one. I demonstrate this functionality
with [the **cola** pacakge](https://bioconductor.org/packages/cola/).

**cola** package heavily uses **ComplexHeatmap** to implement various customized heatmaps
to visualize consensus clustering results as well as downstream analysis. As an example,
the function `get_signatures()` extracts signatures that are significantly different between
the predicted subgroups. `get_signatures()` makes one heatmap and returns a data frame of the 
signatures as well as various statistics for the test.
When `get_signatures()` draws the heatmap, the heatmap object is saved internally, then directly
calling `htShiny()` without the heatmap object will convert the static signature heatmap into an
interactive one:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# the following code is runable
library(cola)  # cola is from Bioconductor
data(golub_cola)
get_signatures(golub_cola["ATC:skmeans"], k = 2) # this makes the heatmap
htShiny()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/signature_heatmap.png")
```

Note the functionality of automatically saving the last heatmap is only turned
on when **InteractiveComplexHeatmap** packags is loaded, which means,
`library(InteractiveComplexHeatmap)` should be called before making the
heatmap, or you need to explicitly set `ComplexHeatmap::ht_opt(save_last = TRUE)`.

Nevertheless, if possible, I still suggest to explictly put the heatmap object
in `htShiny()` which makes it clear which heatmap is becoming interactive.

## Recursive interactive heatmap widgets

In the right panel there is the sub-heatmap that is selected from the left
panel. When the original heatmap is very huge, even a tiny selection rectangle
still generates a dense sub-heatmap where single cells are very hard to
identify and read. In this case, the sub-heatmap can be continually exported
as another independent interactive heatmap widget which is in a new layer
above current one, just by clicking the button  "Interactivate sub-heatmap" under the sub-heatmap.
This process can be recursively applied untill you are satisfied with the details
you can see in the sub-heatmap. An example is as follows:


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/recursive.gif?1")
```

## Live examples

The following code demostrates two horizontally concatenated heatmaps. Please
visit https://jokergoo.shinyapps.io/interactive_complexheatmap/ for a live
demo.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
mat1 = matrix(rnorm(100), 10)
rownames(mat1) = colnames(mat1) = paste0("a", 1:10)
mat2 = matrix(sample(letters[1:10], 100, replace = TRUE), 10)
rownames(mat2) = colnames(mat2) = paste0("b", 1:10)

ht_list = Heatmap(mat1, name = "mat_a", row_km = 2, column_km = 2) +
    Heatmap(mat2, name = "mat_b")
htShiny(ht_list)
```

The following code demostrates two vertically concatenated heatmaps. Check
https://jokergoo.shinyapps.io/interactive_complexheatmap_vertical/ for a live demo.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ht_list = Heatmap(mat1, name = "mat_a", row_km = 2, column_km = 2) %v%
    Heatmap(mat2, name = "mat_b")
htShiny(ht_list)
```


## Integrate with other plots and packages 

The functionality of the interactivity is general. It can be applied to any
heatmap as long as it is generated from the **ComplexHeatmap** package. Thus,
it can turn many other plots into an interactive app.

### Interactive density heatmap

`ComplexHeatmap::densityHeatmap()` returns a `Heatmap` object, so it can
be exported as a Shiny app. Check
https://jokergoo.shinyapps.io/interactive_densityheatmap/ for a live demo. The
example can also be run locally by executing `htShinyExample(2.1)`. The usage
of `htShinyExample()` will be introduced later and in the webpage opened by
`htShinyExample()` there is also the source code for generating this Shiny app.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ht = densityHeatmap(...)
htShiny(ht)
```

### Interactive oncoPrint

`ComplexHeatmap::oncoPrint()` returns a `Heatmap` object, thus, the oncoPrint
can be interactive. Example code is as follows. Check
https://jokergoo.shinyapps.io/interactive_oncoprint/ for a live demo. The
example can be run locally by executing `htShinyExample(2.2)`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ht = oncoPrint(...)
htShiny(ht)

ht = oncoPrint(...) + Heatmap(...) + rowAnnotation(...)
htShiny(ht)
```

### Interactive UpSet plot

`ComplexHeatmap::UpSet()` returns a `Heatmap` object, thus, the UpSet plot
generated by **ComplexHeatmap** can be interactive. It might be useful when
you visualize many sets at the same time. Example code is as follows. Check
https://jokergooo.shinyapps.io/interactive_upset/ for a live demo. The example
can be run locally by executing `htShinyExample(2.3)`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cm = make_comb_mat(...)
ht = UpSet(cm, ...)
htShiny(ht)
```

### Interactive enriched heatmap

[**EnrichedHeatmap**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EnrichedHeatmap.html)
inherits **ComplexHeatmap** and it outputs `Heatmap` objects, thus, an
"enriched heatmap" can be exported as a Shiny app as well. Check
https://jokergoo.shinyapps.io/interactive_enrichedheatmap/ for a live demo.
The example can be run locally by executing `htShinyExample(3.1)`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mat = normalizeToMatrix(...)
ht = EnrichedHeatmap(mat, ...)
htShiny(ht)

ht = EnrichedHeatmap(mat, ...) + EnrichedHeatmap(...) + Heatmap(...)
htShiny(ht)
```

### Interactive pheatmap

Since **ComplexHeatmap** can [seamlessly integrate
**pheatmap**](https://jokergoo.github.io/2020/05/06/translate-from-pheatmap-to-complexheatmap/),
this means your pheatmap can be interactive! Check
https://jokergooo.shinyapps.io/interactive_pheatmap/. The example can be run
locally by executing `htShinyExample(2.4)`.

`ComplexHeatmap::pheatmap()` and `pheatmap::pheatmap()` have the same set of
arguments and generate almost the same heatmaps, but be careful when you
directly use `pheatmap()` without the namespace prefix (the package name), you need
to make sure it is from **ComplexHeatmap** if you want to use the interactive
functionality. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ht = pheatmap(...) # ComplexHeatmap::pheatmap should overwrite pheatmap::pheatmap
htShiny(ht)
```


### Interactive heatmap

To facilitate the users who are still using `heatmap()` and `heatmap.2()`
functions, to make the output of these two functions can be exported as
interactive Shiny apps as well, from **ComplexHeatmap** version 2.7.2, two
similar translation functions `ComplexHeatmap:::heatmap()` and
`ComplexHeatmap:::heatmap.2()` which use the same set of arguments as the
original functions and generate almost identical heatmaps. Then an interactive
`heatmap()` will look like:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ht = ComplexHeatmap:::heatmap(...)
htShiny(ht)
```

As you see, `heatmap()` function is not exported from **ComplexHeatmap** (so that
it will not conflict with **stats** package) and it should be explicitly
specifid with `:::`.

An live example is at https://jokergooo.shinyapps.io/interactive_heatmap/. The
example can be run locally by executing `htShinyExample(2.5)`.


### Interactive heatmap.2

Similarly, an interactive `heatmap.2()` looks like:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ht = ComplexHeatmap:::heatmap.2(...)
htShiny(ht)
```

Similarlly, `heatmap.2()` is not exported from **ComplexHeatmap** (so that it will not
conflict with **glots** package) and it should be specified with `:::`.

An live example is at https://jokergooo.shinyapps.io/interactive_heatmap_2/.
The example can be run locally by executing `htShinyExample(2.6)`.


### Interactive tidyHeatmap

[The **tidyHeatmap** package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyHeatmap)
basically wraps **ComplexHeatmap** and provides "a tidy way" for generating
heatmaps. Since the final heatmap is actually generated by **ComplexHeatmap**,
it can be directly exported as an interactive app. You can directly apply `htShiny()`
on the object generated from **tidyHeatmap**. Check
https://jokergooo.shinyapps.io/interactive_tidyheatmap/. The example can be
run locally by executing `htShinyExample(2.7)`.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyHeatmap)
mtcars_tidy <- 
    mtcars %>% 
    as_tibble(rownames="Car name") %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(-`Car name`, -hp, -vs), scale) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -c(`Car name`, hp, vs), names_to = "Property", values_to = "Value")

mtcars_heatmap <- 
    mtcars_tidy %>% 
        heatmap(`Car name`, Property, Value ) %>%
        add_tile(hp)

htShiny(mtcars_heatmap)
```

### Other tips

As explained before, for all these functions and packages that generate
customized heatmaps, if the heatmaps are already generated in the interactive
graphics device, the heatmap objects can be ommited when calling `htShiny()`.
E.g.:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ComplexHeatmap::pheatmap(...)
htShiny()

oncoPrint(...)
htShiny()
```

## Examples shipped with the package

There are many other examples shipped with the **InteractiveComplexHeatmap**
package. The list of examples can be obtained by executing
`htShinyExample()` with no argument.


```{r}
htShinyExample()
```

You can select one specific example by sending the corresponding index to
`htShinyExample()`, e.g. to run the example "4. A single heatmap where rows
and columns are split.", simply run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
htShinyExample(1.4)
```

Then the interactive heatmaps as well as the source code for generating the app
will be available in the webpage.

Have fun!
