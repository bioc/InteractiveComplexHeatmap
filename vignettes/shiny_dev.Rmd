## Usage

`htShiny()` can export heatmaps as a stand-alone Shiny app. **InteractiveComplexHeatmap** also provides two
functions for integrating the interactive heatmap widgets into other Shiny apps. The two functions are:

- `InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput()`: for building UI on the client side.
- `renderInteractiveComplexHeatmap()`: for processing on the sever side.

The usage is simple. Following is an example that you can directly copy and paste to your R session.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ComplexHeatmap)
library(InteractiveComplexHeatmap)
library(shiny)

m = matrix(rnorm(100*100), nrow = 100)
ht = Heatmap(m)
ht = draw(ht)

ui = fluidPage(
    h3("My first interactive ComplexHeatmap Shiny app"),
    InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput()
)

server = function(input, output, session) {
    renderInteractiveComplexHeatmap(ht, input, output, session)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/app_demo1.png")
```

You can also put multiple interactive heatmaps widgets in a single Shiny app,
but this time you must assign a "**heatmap ID**" for each one, so that
`renderInteractiveComplexHeatmap()` can find the correct heatmap to response.
The heatmap ID should start with letters.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ht1 = Heatmap(m, col = c("white", "blue"))
ht1 = draw(ht1)
ht2 = Heatmap(m, col = c("white", "red"))
ht2 = draw(ht2)

ui = fluidPage(
    h3("The first heatmap"),
    InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput("heatmap_1"),
    hr(),
    h3("The second heatmap"),
    InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput("heatmap_2")
)

server = function(input, output, session) {
    renderInteractiveComplexHeatmap(ht1, input, output, session, "heatmap_1")
    renderInteractiveComplexHeatmap(ht2, input, output, session, "heatmap_2")
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/app_demo2.png")
```


## Customize the widgets

The original heatmap and the sub-heatmap can be resized by dragging the two
boxes, but still, `InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput()` has arguments `width1`,
`width2`, `height1` and `height2` that control the initial sizes of the two
boxes. You can check `htShinyExample(17)` where the size of the heatmap box is
manually set to make sure the heatmap is well visible.

By default, to get the information of a single cell in the heatmap, a "click"
action is used. In `InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput()`, you can also set the
action to `"hover"` or `"dblclick"` to change the action. Note no matter the
action is a click or a hover, when applying the brush action, click or hover
will always be first applied and you will see the output for a single cell
appears and fastly disappears. Currently I don't have a solution to get rid of
that.

The initial style of the brush can be specified by `brush_opt` argument. The
value should be a list and the value will be sent to `shiny::brushOpts()`. Note,
the style of the brush can also be manually adjusted in the web page of the Shiny app.

## Work with R Markdown documents

It is very straightforward to integrate **InteractiveComplexHeatmap** in an
interactive R Markdown document, just in a same way of integrating normal Shiny
widgets. Following is an example and you can run a real interactive document
with heatmaps by `htShinyExample(30)`.

```


## Self-define the output

Both the click and brush actions on the heatmap trigger an output below the
heatmaps. The output gives the information of which row(s) and columns(s) are
selected by users. The reponse for the two actions can be self-defined.

In `renderInteractiveComplexHeatmap()`, there are two arguments `click_action`
and `brush_action` which accept self-defined functions and define how to
response after the heatmap is clicked or brushed. The input for the two
functions should accept two argumnts, one is a `DataFrame` object which
contains the information of which row(s) and columns(s) are selected by users,
and the second argument should always be `output` which is used in the Shiny
app.

To use `click_action` or `brush_action`, a `htmlOutput` (or other similar
`*Output`) should be first setup in the UI, then the Shiny app knows where to
update the output.

The `click_action` or `brush_action` is basically defined as follows (assume
the ID set in `htmlOutput()` is `"info"`):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
function(df, output) {
    output[["info"]] = renderUI({  # or output$info = ...
        if(is.null(df)) { # have not clicked into the heatmap body
            ...
        } else {
            ...
        }
    })
}
```

If users didn't click or brush inside the heatmap body (e.g. clicked in the
dendrograms), `df` that is passed to the functions will be `NULL`. Users might
need to perform a sanity check here and print specific output when the heatmap
was not selected.

The format of `df` is slightly different between click and brush. If it is a
click action, `df` has the same format as the returned object of
`selectPosition()` function, which looks like follows. It always has one row.

```
## DataFrame with 1 row and 6 columns
##       heatmap                  slice row_slice column_slice row_index
##   <character>            <character> <numeric>    <numeric> <integer>
## 1       mat_a mat_a_heatmap_body_1_2         1            2         9
##   column_index
##      <integer>
## 1            1
```

If it is a brush action, `df` has the same format as the returned object of
`selectArea()` function, which looks like in the following chunk. Each line
contains row and column indices of the selected sub-matrix in a specific
heatmap slice of a specific heatmap.

```
## DataFrame with 4 rows and 6 columns
##       heatmap                  slice row_slice column_slice     row_index
##   <character>            <character> <numeric>    <numeric> <IntegerList>
## 1       mat_a mat_a_heatmap_body_1_2         1            2     7,5,2,...
## 2       mat_a mat_a_heatmap_body_2_2         2            2           6,3
## 3       mat_b mat_b_heatmap_body_1_1         1            1     7,5,2,...
## 4       mat_b mat_b_heatmap_body_2_1         2            1           6,3
##    column_index
##   <IntegerList>
## 1     2,4,1,...
## 2     2,4,1,...
## 3     1,2,3,...
## 4     1,2,3,...
```

In the following example, in the UI, I add a new `htmlOutput` with ID `info`.
On the sever side, I define `click_action` to print a styled text and define
`brush_action` to print the table of the selected rows and columns from the
heatmap. Note I also set `default_click_action = FALSE, default_brush_action =
FALSE` in `renderInteractiveComplexHeatmap()` to turn off the default responses.

You can also run the following example simply by `htShinyExample(21)`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(GetoptLong)  # for the qq() function which does variable intepolation
m = matrix(rnorm(100*100), 100)
rownames(m) = paste0("R", 1:100)
colnames(m) = paste0("C", 1:100)
ht = Heatmap(m, show_row_names = FALSE, show_column_names = FALSE, row_km = 2, column_km = 2)
ht = draw(ht)

ui = fluidPage(
    InteractiveComplexHeatmapOutput(),
    htmlOutput("info")
)

click_action = function(df, output) {
    output[["info"]] = renderUI({
        if(!is.null(df)) {
            HTML(qq("<p style='background-color:#FF8080;color:white;padding:5px;'>You have clicked on heatmap @{df$heatmap}, row @{df$row_index}, column @{df$column_index}</p>"))
        }
    })
}

library(kableExtra)
brush_action = function(df, output) {
    row_index = unique(unlist(df$row_index))
    column_index = unique(unlist(df$column_index))
    output[["info"]] = renderUI({
        if(!is.null(df)) {
            HTML(kable_styling(kbl(m[row_index, column_index, drop = FALSE], digits = 2, format = "html")))
        }
    })
}

server = function(input, output, session) {
    renderInteractiveComplexHeatmap(ht, input, output, session,
        click_action = click_action, brush_action = brush_action,
        default_click_action = FALSE, default_brush_action = FALSE)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/customize_output.png")
```

`htShinyExample(22)` gives another scenario where the output needs to be
self-defined. In that example, an gene expression matrix is visualized and
clicking on the heatmap will print the corresponding gene and some other
annotations related to this gene (e.g. the corresponding gene symbol, RefSeq
IDs and UniProt IDs). Run `htShinyExample(22)` to see how this is implemented.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/customize_output2.png")
```

One last example is `htShinyExample(23)` where the heatmap visualizes
correlations of a list of Gene Ontology terms (The plot is generated by [the
**simplifyEnrichment**
package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/simplifyEnrichment/)). In this
example, the click and brush actions are self-defined so that the selected GO
IDs as well as their detailed descriptions are printed.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/customize_output3.png")
```


## Dynamicly generate interactive heatmap widget

In previous examples, the heatmaps are already generated before making the
interactive app. There are also scenarios where the heatmaps are generated on
the fly, e.g. when the matrix is dynamically generated in the middle of an
analysis or there are multiple matrices and the heatmap is generated according
to user's selection.

There are two other functions `InteractiveComplexHeatmapModal()` and
`InteractiveComplexHeatmapWidget()` which have very similar behaviors. These
two functions are normally put inside e.g. `shiny::observeEvent()` and they
generate UI as well as rendering the interactive heatmaps.

First I will introduce the usage of `InteractiveComplexHeatmapModal()`. In the
following example, there is only an action button in the UI, and in the server
function, `InteractiveComplexHeatmapModal()` is called when receiving an `input$show_heatmap`
signal. This example can also be run by `htShinyExample(25)`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui = fluidPage(
    actionButton("show_heatmap", "Generate_heatmap"),
)

server = function(input, output, session) {
    m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10)
    ht = Heatmap(m)

    observeEvent(input$show_heatmap, {
        InteractiveComplexHeatmapModal(input, output, session, ht)
    })
}
shiny::shinyApp(ui, server)
```

As shown in the following figure, `InteractiveComplexHeatmapModal()` will open
an "modal" which includes the interactive heatmaps. Clicking outside closes
the widget.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/dynamic_widget.gif")
```

In the next example (`htShinyExample(26)`), a different heatmap is generated
according to user's selection.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui = fluidPage(
    radioButtons("select", "Select", c("Numeric" = 1, "Character" = 2)),
    actionButton("show_heatmap", "Generate_heatmap"),
)

get_heatmap_fun = function(i) {
    mat_list = list(
        matrix(rnorm(100), 10),
        matrix(sample(letters[1:10], 100, replace = TRUE), 10)
    )
    Heatmap(mat_list[[i]])
}

server = function(input, output, session) {
    observeEvent(input$show_heatmap, {
        i = as.numeric(input$select)
        InteractiveComplexHeatmapModal(input, output, session, 
            get_heatmap = get_heatmap_fun(i))
    })
}
shiny::shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/dynamic_widget_radio_selection.gif")
```

The usage of `InteractiveComplexHeatmapWidget()` is very similar as
`InteractiveComplexHeatmapModal()`, except that now for
`InteractiveComplexHeatmapWidget()`, user needs to allocate a place
defined by `shiny::htmlOutput()` in UI, and later the interactive heatmap widget is
put there.

I modify the previous example with `InteractiveComplexHeatmapWidget()`. Now in the UI, 
I add one line with `htmlOutput()` with ID `heatmap_output`, and this ID is set
in `InteractiveComplexHeatmapWidget()` correspondingly.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui = fluidPage(
    actionButton("show_heatmap", "Generate_heatmap"),
    htmlOutput("heatmap_output")
)

server = function(input, output, session) {
    m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10)
    ht = Heatmap(m)
    
    observeEvent(input$show_heatmap, {
        InteractiveComplexHeatmapWidget(input, output, session, ht, output_id = "heatmap_output")
    })
}
shiny::shinyApp(ui, server)
```

The app looks like follows:


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/dynamic_widget2.gif")
```

`InteractiveComplexHeatmapWidget()` and `InteractiveComplexHeatmapWidget()`
all accept an argument `js_code` where customized JavaScript code can be
inserted after the interactive UI. This is sometimes useful. In previous
example where the heatmap widget is triggered by clicking on the action
button, every time when clicking on the button, the widget is regenerated
although the heatmaps are actually the same. Actually we can change the
behavior of the button that from the second click it just switches the
visibility of the heatmap widget. Note here we also need to set `cancel_action = "hide"`
so that the heatmap UI is not removed from HTML document after it is closed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui = fluidPage(
    actionButton("show_heatmap", "Generate_heatmap"),
    htmlOutput("heatmap_output")
)

server = function(input, output, session) {
    m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10)
    ht = Heatmap(m)
    
    observeEvent(input$show_heatmap, {
        InteractiveComplexHeatmapWidget(input, output, session, ht, 
            output_id = "heatmap_output", cancel_action = "hide",

            js_code = function(heatmap_id) {
                "$('#show_heatmap').click(function() {
                    $('#heatmap_output').toggle('slow');
                }).text('Show/hide heatmap').
                   attr('id', 'show_heatmap_toggle');
            "}
        )
    })
}
shiny::shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("https://jokergoo.github.io/images/dynamic_widget3.gif")
```
